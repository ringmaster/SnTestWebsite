Welcome to Sn!!!  Sn is intended to be a lightweight blog/website engine.  You should only need to run the Sn binary (or `go run sn.go` from source) to have a fully-functioning site with some of these characteristics:

* Automatic LetsEncrypt support for TLS
* In-memory searchable database of a "repo" of posts and pages
* Realtime markdown rendering of those posts and pages according to URL requests

The text you are currently reading is part of a single markdown post that Sn is rendering.  You can [open the web editing UI to write a post.](/_/frontend)
